this is still in a REALLY REALLY Early stage, like not even usable   

If ye like this concept then PLEASE Help Out!  
I cant do it all by myself... :/  

# General Ideas
- asm but with high level features, like iterators and closures  
- very hands on   
- most things are represented as just series of bits making ye have to think bout how stuff maps in mem  
- For now: Compile to asm, and let nasm do the rest  

# Features Implemented
- Calling `nasm` and `ld`

# Features Planned Next
- Remove temp files
- Loops  
- Comments  
- Subroutines (Basics)  
- definitions  
- miltiple files
